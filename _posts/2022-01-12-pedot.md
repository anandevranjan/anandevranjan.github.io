Development of transparent and plastic electronics is one of the demanding interest of present days. But the common metal presents a challenge for this advancement as they are neither transparent nor flexible in small domains. In this regard organic polymers are better candidate but the low conductivity of these materials makes them not ideal due to high ohmic losses. Here we report an in-situ patterning and subsequent doping technique for dispersed organic polymers resulting in one order of higher conductivity. Although the technique is quite general but for the proof of concept we choose one organic polymer called poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). The patterned PEDOT:PSS shows one order higheer conductivity then the pristine sample. We further improve the conductivity of patterning a layer by layer deposition of PSS:PEDOT on a flexible PDMS subtrate. This further improves the flexibility and results in even higher conductivity without any use of external doping agent or harsh chemicals. This raises exciting possibilities in development of high-efficiency flexible electronics, and in the fabrication of heterostructures which may eventually be used to make electronic devices using conducting polymers.
