In situ patterning of biomolecules and living organisms while retaining their biological activity is extremely challenging, primarily because such patterning typically involves thermal stresses that could be substantially higher than the physiological thermal or stress tolerance level. Top-down patterning approaches are especially prone to these issues, while bottom-up approaches suffer from a lack of control in developing defined structures and the time required for patterning. A microbubble generated and manipulated by optical tweezers (microbubble lithography) is used to self-assemble and pattern living organisms in continuous microscopic structures in real-time, where the material thus patterned remains biologically active due to their ability to withstand elevated temperatures for short exposures. Successful patterns of microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Lactococcus. lactis and the Type A influenza virus) are demonstrated, as well as reporter proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) on functionalized substrates with high signal-to-noise ratio and selectivity. Together, the data presented herein may open up fascinating possibilities in rapid in situ parallelized diagnostics of multiple pathogens and bioelectronics.
