Evaporating sessile droplets have been known to exhibit oscillations on the air-liquid interface. These are generally over millimeter scales. Using a novel approach, we are able to measure surface height changes of 500 nm amplitude using optical trapping of a set of microscopic particles at the interface, particularly when the vertical thickness of the droplet reduces to less than 50 𝜇m. We find that at the later stages of the droplet evaporation, particularly when the convection currents become large, the top air-water interface starts to spontaneously oscillate vertically as a function of time in consistency with predictions. We also detect travelling wave trains moving in the azimuthal direction of the drop surface which are consistent with hydrothermal waves at a different combination of Reynolds, Prandtl and Evaporation numbers than previously observed. This is the first time that wave-trains have been observed in water, being extremely challenging to detect both interferometrically and with infra-red cameras. We also find that such waves apply a force parallel to the interface along the propagation direction.
