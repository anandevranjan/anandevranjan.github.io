<h1> Welcome All to my site </h1>
<p> I am Anand Dev Ranjan, a reseach scholar at the <a href="https://physics.iiserkol.ac.in/phd_hompage.php?did=eGxheUpPOU9iYUR5TUtHamJMblRNRmg5UWxUdFhJOTFFQTdKNURPUGIwYz0=">Department of Physical Sciences</a> at <a href="https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/web/en/">IISER Kolkata </a>. I currently focus on two significant challenges in today’s world. Firstly, the growing demand for faster and more cost-effective biosensors, supplemented by a need for more congenial fabrication strategies. Specifically, my work focusses on 'microbubble lithography' - a technique for developing microscopic patterns of diverse materials using microbubbles created by a high -intensity laser spot inside optical tweezers. I pursue research with a motivation to serve both science and society.  
<p>  Microbubbles are nucleated when a tightly focussed laser light falls on an absorbing sample. The resulting microbubble also leads to the formation of a flow called as the "Marangoni flow". As the flow is manisfested due to the presence of microbubble so tranlating the microbubble leads to the translation of the flow. Since, microbubble is formed due to the laser so translationg the laser leads to tranlsation of the microbubble resuting in the translation of flow. Tranlsating the microbubble leads to the formation of patterns of the dispersed particles due to the irreversible self-assembly. My work is to find the dynamics of this process and apply this patterning to immobilise biomaterials and conducting polymers at specific location on the glass substrate. As you can see my work is a bit interdisciplinary which lies at the intersection of Optics, Fluid dynamics and Statistical Physics. I am also involved in theoretical modelling Currently I am working on a protoptype to develop a miltiple disease sensing platform research interests are I am mostly working in optical physics but my research topic is quite interdisciplinary. I am currently working on a project to immobilise bioparticles on specific location of glass slide applying the optical tweezers.  </p>
